# Jore 3 => Jore 4 importer

This tool implements a batch job for importing data from a Jore 3 database to a Jore 4 database.

## Running the app locally

### Setup

1. Install preliminaries
  - OpenJDK 11
1. Make a copy of the maven `dev`-profile for your user:
    ```
    cp profiles/dev/config.properties profiles/dev/config.<my-username>.properties
    ```
1. Adjust the `source.db.*` properties in `profiles/dev/config.<my-username>.properties` to your needs. Other configuration for destination database and test database may also be found from here.
1. If you wish to connect to the original JORE3 database, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/jore4/blob/main/wiki/onboarding.md#creating-an-ssh-configuration-entry) on how to create a tunnel and connect to the database. After the tunnel is created, the jore3 database will be available on localhost:56239. Ask for the username and password from the project team. 

### Run 

The `development.sh` is a simple utility script for starting the development and test dependencies (e.g. databases).

The dependencies must be up and running for both running this app locally or for running tests. Note that for generating the jooq classes for build, the test database must be running. Run `./development.sh start:deps`

Most of the runtime environment is configured in `profiles/dev/config.<my-username>.properties`. However, some values must be supplied manually:

- `JORE_IMPORTER_MIGRATE`: At the moment this app requires that the destination database is already up-to-date (e.g. database migrations are handled by another party). If `JORE_IMPORTER_MIGRATE` is set to `true`, this app will perform the migrations. This should only be enabled in local development when using the dockerized local database!

You can create a local `run.sh` script for supplying these arguments:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

JORE_IMPORTER_MIGRATE=true \
  mvn clean spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Xmx128m"
```

The importer will be available through http://localhost:8080. See instructions below on how to trigger importing through the HTTP API.

## Building the app

Note that the `dev` profile is only meant for use in your local development environment. To create a build to be used for deployment, compile and create a package using the `prod` profile:
```
mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage -Pprod
```

## Running tests

For running the tests, you need to have the test databases up an running:
```sh
./development.sh start:deps
```

Then start the tests with:
```sh
mvn --batch-mode clean verify
```

## Triggering the batch job

The import can be triggered using a HTTP API. The `POST /job/import/start` endpoint will start the job and return its status. If a previous job instance was already running, a new job is not started and the return value will reflect the status of the running job.

```shell
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/job/import/start/
{"id":0,"batchStatus":"STARTING","exitCode":"UNKNOWN","exitDescription":null,"startTime":null,"endTime":null}
```

### Querying the status of the latest import

The `GET /job/import/status` endpoint returns information about the latest import. If no import has been performed, a HTTP 204 status is returned.

While the import is running:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/job/import/status/
{"id":5,"batchStatus":"STARTED","exitCode":"UNKNOWN","exitDescription":null,"startTime":"2021-04-09T08:35:51.560Z","endTime":null}
```

After the import is complete:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/job/import/status/
{"id":5,"batchStatus":"COMPLETED","exitCode":"COMPLETED","exitDescription":null,"startTime":"2021-04-09T08:35:51.560Z","endTime":"2021-04-09T08:36:11.308Z"}
```

If an error occurs:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:8080/job/import/status/
{"id":5,"batchStatus":"FAILED","exitCode":"FAILED","exitDescription":"<here's a really long Java stack trace>","startTime":"2021-04-09T08:39:47.698Z","endTime":"2021-04-09T08:41:17.761Z"}
```
